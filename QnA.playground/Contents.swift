/// CGFloat depends upon the CPU architecture. Which means if build is for 64 bit CPU then CGFloat is equivalent
/// to Double type and when build is for 32 bit CPU then CGFloat is equivalent to Float type.
/// In CGBase.h header a typedef is defined for the same based on architecture of CPU.
/// CGFloat even has a property `var native: CGFloat.NativeType` which tell its type (Double or Float)

/// `What causes a deadlock? Code example showing a deadlock scenario?`
///
/// A deadlock occurs if for example say there are two tasks which are waiting for each other to finish. Let's say
/// we synchronously submit some task on main queue. Main queue is serial queue. Adding any task to main
/// queue synchronously basically creates a deadlock.
///
/// Trying to execute below DispatchQueue block will make below runtime exception :
/// `error: Execution was interrupted, reason: EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (code=EXC_I386_INVOP, subcode=0x0).`

/// Example 1 :
/// Here a deadlock occurs as the current context is Main itself. So we are dispatching some task synchronously
/// making main queue wait till the task is finished. But the task is dispatched to the main queue itself which is
/// waiting for the task to finish so it won't perform the task. So this creates a deadlock.
//DispatchQueue.main.sync {
//    print("This will not get printed")
//}

/// Example 2 :
/// Here again the current context is Main. From main a task is dispatched to a serial queue synchronously. Main
/// queue will wait till the task is finished. No deadloack is caused if the second print statement is not dispatched.
/// However once the second print statement is dispatched from within the task block deadlock occurs.
/// Reason for deadlock is that for second print statement task the current context is the serialQueue which is
/// a serial queue so will execute tasks one by one. It's executing a task and synchronously another task is given
/// to it. The second print statement forms a part of original task itself so unless that is performed second print
/// statement can't be executed. But unless second print is executed original task can't be completed. Hence
/// deadlock.

/// 1. For simple UI, MVVM may turn out to be overkill.
///
/// 2. For bigger complex projects view-models itself could be hard to design to achieve abstraction and generality.
///
/// 3. View-model use data-binding to communicate with views. Data-bindings is declarative and can be harder
/// to debug.
///
/// 4. MVVM might lead to writing same pattern of code in multiple view-models.
///
/// 5. MVVM adaptation might lead to a tight coupling with UI framework which is being used for e.g. UIKit or SwiftUI.
/// If same codebase is required to work with some other UI framework in future then its challenging.

/// Yes, there will be side effects. It's important to call parent class overridden methods for certain methods ONLY.
/// For e.g. there is a view controller's lifecycle method `loadView()` this needs to be implemented when not
/// using any storyboard or XIBs, but this implementation in a UIViewController's subclass should NOT call super.

///
/// Now talking about `viewDidLoad` from `UIViewController` itself, the immediate subclass can skip

/// to call, which is in case of `loadView()` as the documentation for `loadView()` warns not to call super.
///
/// Not calling super in overridden implementation when expected can have following consequences :
///
/// 1. UIViewController is always aubclassed and not used directly. Further as being object oriented and class type
/// one always have inheritance and some other view-controller's inheriting from a base viewcontroller. Whatever the
/// setting being, if there is a hierarchy and the child misses calling it's super cycle methods wherever required
/// will leave the viewcontroller's setup itself incomplete.

/// - Viewcontroller will create appropriate bindings between view model and view. This binding is what communicates

/// - Viewcontroller will offcource continue to handle user input, it anyways is a part of responder chain. Also it

// MARK: Question 17
/// `In a MVVM design pattern how does view-model receives information?`

/// MVVM design pattern consists of Model - View - ViewModel. There exists a binding between view and

/// is able to communicate changes to view layer when to update.
/// This communication can be done via help of a controller which can create bindings and pass on information
/// related to user events to view-model. Or in case of using a reactive framework like Combine this could be
/// done using a publisher subscriber model wherein the view subscribes to view-model published properties.
/// In reactive case for example if using SwiftUI+Combine the view can directly provide information of user events
/// like selecting an option on some ui component, entering some text etc. Once user event happens view-model
/// appropriate handler can be called to let view-model get that information.
///
/// View-model also contains business logic and it is also responsible for communicating changes happened to
/// model layer back to the view layer. So it must receive information about model changes which it receives from

/// NO
/// No, functions in Swift do not have a retain count. This is because functions are not objects. They are simply
/// blocks of code that are executed when they are called. Functions are first-class citizens in Swift, which means
/// that they can be treated like variables and passed around as values.
/// When a function is called, the compiler creates a new stack frame for the function. This stack frame contains

// MARK: Question 20
/// `Does closures in Swift have retain count?`
///
/// YES
/// Closures are reference types so they have retain count. Reference types are objects that can be referenced
/// by other objects. When a closure is referenced by another object, the closure's retain count is incremented.
/// This means that the closure will not be deallocated until its retain count reaches zero.

/// check
///
/// In below example `ImplicitUnwrappedOptional` defines a property `iuo` which is implicitly unwrapped

/// one cannot access IBOutlets before the view controller's viewDidLoad() method is called.
/// Accessing an IBOutlet before the view controller's viewDidLoad() method is called, your app will crash.
///
/// One more use-case for implicitly unwrapped optionals is that Objective-C doesn't guarantees if an object is

/// `Slicing is the process of creating and delivering variants of the app bundle for different target devices`
/// `App Slicing` helps delivering only relevant assets to each device downloading App. App slicing is done
/// by App store when an app is submitted to it. So this means that the app uploaded to App store continues to
/// be the full version with all assets required for all possible devices. The app store will slice the app based on
/// devices app supports.

/// `Bitcode`
/// With bitcode enabled(this can be enabled from Xcode for a target/project), when an application is archived, then, the

/// One can consider various apspects in order to design a scalable and reusable architecture for an iOS App.
///
/// 1. `Architectures` : One should choose an architectural pattern to follow and decide based on what suits
/// the application the most. MVC could be a good starting point for simple applications. Alternatives which can
/// be considered are MVVM, Clean architecture or VIPER.
///
/// 2. One must follow principle of `Separation of Concerns` while developing the application modules
/// types and components. This help to isolate responsibilities. isolating responsibilities helps to reduce bulk
/// handling by a single type therby reducing stron coupling and less chances of intrducing bugs. Also bug found
/// in one isolated component could mean the fix could be easily found and fixed without affecting whole lot of
/// other codebase.
///
/// 3. Ensure using `Dependency Injection` this again will prevent loose coupling and also contribute
/// towards making the code more flexible and testable via unit testing.
///
/// 4. Leverage modern programming paradigms like reactive programming using frameworks like `Combine`
/// For an iOS app using `Combine` framework to handle event driven behaviour can greatly simplify the code
/// and make code lot cleaner.
///
/// 5. Target `Unit Testing` for the app and aim for a good code coverage. Unit testing and aim to achieve
/// a good code coverage forces to write the code itself in a testable manner reducing some issues like tight
/// coupling and single responsibility principle violations.

// MARK: Question 28
/// `What is the role of protocols in iOS development? How do they promote code reusability and maintainability?`
///
/// `Code Reusability`
/// One can declare protocol which multiple type can conform to. One can also club multiple protocols and create
/// a protocol composition. One can add some implementation via protocol extensions thereby all conforming type
/// getting that implementation automatically.
/// These feature enable multiple objects even though unrelated, can obtain a common functionality by conforming
/// to a protocol.
///
/// `Interoperability`
/// One get Interoperability by protocol as unrelated objects can communicate to each other via protocol.
///
/// `Loose Coupling`
/// When objects communicate via protocols, then there is loose coupling between objects instead on the case
/// when the objects directly refer to each other anc communicate.
///
/// `Dependency Injection`
/// Procols are used to procide dependencies to objects, instead of direclty instantiating the object itself. This also
/// leaves option to provide mock data by adhering to the protocol and creating a mock object. Thus way it also
/// helps achieving unit testing.
///
/// `Multiple Inheritance`
/// A type can conform to multiple protocols thus getting behaviours from multiple sources.


// MARK: -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// MARK: Question 29
/// `How would you ensure efficient networking and data loading in an iOS app? What techniques or frameworks would you use?`
///
/// `Asynchronous`
/// Network requests should be made asynchronously so as to avoid blocking main thread, which is where all
/// UI related events and tasks takes place, Any network request if happens on main thread will block the main
/// thread and make UI unresponsive leading to extremely bad user experience.
///
/// `Caching`
/// Design networking with appropriate caching in mind as it will allow to possibly cache some request responses
/// which could not be changing too frequently so avoid making unecessary network traffic. This improves performance
/// of the app.
/// If one has to load many images then it's always best to use image caching so as to provide a smooth UI
/// experience.
///
/// `Pagination`
/// While designing UI for a very large data set, techniques like pagination can be employed so as to display
/// as well as load small data sets at a time. This reduces the payload of network request and makes a smooth
/// user experience.
///
/// `Background Fetch & Push Notifications`
/// Background Fetch and Push Notifications can be employed to efficiently give updaetes ensuring the app
/// has latest information available without blindly making too many network calls while app is being used. This
/// helps users perceiving less loading time altogether.
///
/// `Optimized Data Formats`
/// Use some Optimized data formats for transfer payloads and design APIs in away to only receive what's needed
/// and not let the payload with a lot of clutter which isn't going to be used at all.
///
/// `Request Prioritization and Throttling`
/// Implement mechanisms to prioritize network requests based on their importance or urgency. Throttling
/// techniques, such as debouncing or rate limiting, can prevent excessive or unnecessary network requests,
/// improving performance and conserving resources.
///
/// `Reachability`
/// Frameworks like `Reachability` could be used to monitor network reachability and thereby handling to
/// take appropriate actions and provide feedback to user.
///
/// `Performance Monitoring and Analytics`
/// Incorporate performance monitoring and analytics tools, such as Firebase Performance Monitoring or New
/// Relic, to track and analyze network-related metrics. This helps identify bottlenecks, optimize performance,
/// and make informed decisions for further improvements.
///
/// `Background Transfer Service`
/// Use the Background Transfer Service provided by iOS to handle large file downloads or uploads in the
/// background, even when the app is not actively running. This allows the app to continue transferring data
/// efficiently, even if the user switches to a different app or the device enters a low-power state.


// MARK: -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// MARK: Question 30
/// `What is App Analytics (from App Store Connect)?`
///
/// `App Analytics` provides with insightful data about downloads, re-downloads, proceeds and more. It provides
/// helpful data while respecting user's privacy. It provides several metrics for example :
///
/// `Impression`
/// Any time a user sees the app icon is counted as an impression. App Analytics provides impressions over
/// time period, this data can be viewed over time.
///
/// `Project page view`
/// Any time a user sees app's project page is counted as project page view. Project page also contains the app
/// icon, so a project page view also increases impression by one.
///
/// There are also variations of these metrics namely `Unique impressions` and `Unique product page view`
/// For example, if someone searches for an app and sees the app in search results, then this is counted as an
/// impression as search result if returns the app will show app icon. Now when from search results when user
/// taps search result of an app then user is taken to that app's home page view. In this case there are two
/// impressions and one product page view AND just one unique impression as both impressions are from same
/// user.
///
/// `Conversion rate`
/// Conversion rate is the percentage of people who downloads the app after seeing it on app store. This is calculated
/// by taking total downloads and total unique impressions.
///
/// `Total downloads`
/// Total downloads include both first-time downloads(GET or BUY button) and re-downloads(Cloud icon with
/// arrow, autodownloads are not included when re-downloads are counted)
///
/// These metrics help to understand how effectively one is acquiring the users.
///
/// App analytics also helps to discover how users are discovering apps by territory, source type and page type.
/// One can for example view metrics by territory, like one can see conversion rate as per territory and get to
/// understand which territory has low conversion rate and then work on it.
///
/// Source type
/// 1. App store browse
/// 2. App store search (someone finds and downloads)
/// 3. App referrer (someone discover app inside another app on app store, could be in-app advertisement)
/// 4. Web referrer (through weblink via web advertisement, if app is discovered through browser other than
/// safari then it will show up as an app refer for that browser, instead of web refer)
///
/// Page type
/// 1. Product page (the app store product page)
/// 2. Store sheet (looks similar to product page, but exists outside the app store, pops from bottom of screen,
/// this is SKStoreProductViewController)
/// 3. No page (when  user downloads app without visiting product page, by directly tapping link on app store page)
///
/// Peer group benchmark
/// This puts performance of app into context by comparing the performance to that of similar apps.


// MARK: -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// MARK: Question 31
/// `How would you design an iOS app that needs to be able to handle a large number of users?`
///
/// There are many aspects to look into when designing an iOS app to handle large number of users.
///
/// 1. Backend Architecture.
/// iOS App will be one to one or to say the device having App is used by one user at a time, so multiple users
/// are actually going to have impact on the backend services which are going to take the load. So basically the
/// backend should be scalable.
///     - Backend itself should be scalable to address increase in load
///     - Load balancer should be used to help manage incoming traffic
///     - Caching layer could be implemented at backend to provide faster turnaround time for frequently accessed data
///     - Serverless architecture could be leveraged to run services without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
///
/// 2. Database Management
/// Database should be scalable as per the load expected, and NoSQL databases should be opted if large amount
/// of data which can grow is expected. Database indexing, sharding or partitioning should be implemented to
/// optimise queries and distribute load across multiple servers.
///
/// 3. Asynchronous Operations
/// Asynchronous techniques must be used to prevent app freezing UI giving an extremely bad user experience.
/// Using asynchronous operations smartly gives user impression of fast and responsive app and helps reducing
/// perceived stress on backend services.
///
/// 4. Caching
/// One can plan to cache data which doesn't change frequently on the fron end itself so as to reduce traffic on
/// backend thereby reducing the stress on it.
///
/// 5. Content Delivery Network
/// CDNs can help providing content like assets, images, videos etc. These CDN can provide from geographically
/// distributed servers to minimize latency and improve download speeds.
///
/// 6. Analytics
/// Implement analytics to capture data. This captured data can help paint a picture of how users are using the
/// app and can help understand the areas that might need improvements.

///
/// `Function Inlining`
/// Function inlining is a compiler optimization technique used in programming languages to improve the
/// performance of a program by replacing a function call with the actual code of the function. In other words,
/// instead of executing a separate function call instruction, the compiler includes the function's code directly
/// at the location where it's called. This can eliminate the overhead associated with function calls, such as
/// pushing and popping data onto the call stack and jumping to a different part of the program's code.
/// Though this provides a great performance boost, this also increases the size of binaries as this can lead to
/// code duplication in a way.
///
/// Now coming back to `Swift` and `@inline`. Swift compiler can automatically perform some inlining based
/// of weather it's optimizing for speed or for binary size.
///
/// Now Swift compiler can take it's own decision, however using `@inline` attribute one can force Swift
/// compiler to behave differently. There are two options available :-
/// ```
/// 1. @inline(__always): Signals the compiler to always inline the method, if possible.
/// 2. @inline(never): Signals the compiler to never inline the method.
/// ```
///
/// Should `@inline` be used?

/// in this scenario knows everything about the module. However if to this module we add a framework or a library

/**
 `Key Value Coding & Key Value Observing`
 
 `Key-Value Coding (KVC)`
 It is a technique in Objective-C and to some extent in Swift, which allows one to access an object's properties
 indirectly using string identifiers. This implies one can get or set value of a property using a string rather than
 accessing the property directly.
 
 `Key-Value Observing (KVO)`
 It is a mechanism which allows objects to be notified of changes to specified properties of other objects. It's commonly
 used for implementing the observer pattern, enabling one object to observe changes in another object's properties.
 
 `Is KVC & KVO available in Swift?`
 Yes KVS and KVO are available in Swift, however it works with some constraints.

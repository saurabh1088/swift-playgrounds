/**
 `Abstract Factory`
 
 `Abstract Factory` is a creational design pattern which is used when requirement is to create a group of
 related objects.
 
 In abtract factory design pattern we usually have some abstract products(protocols) which are conformed by a
 variety of different concrete products. Then we have a abstract factory again a protocol which defines contract
 for creating some products, a concrete abstract factory then implements logic to create products.
 Now the client using products will be using abstract factory to get relevant products as per need.

/// Example 1
/// `AbstractSwiftUIButton` and `AbstractSwiftUIList` are abstract products. In Swift defined
/// as protocols. `IPhoneButton` and `MACButton` are concrete implementations as per use cases. Here
/// the use case is creating a UI component library then implementing it for various platforms (iOS, macOS, iPadOS etc)
///
/// In the example below we have two products `Button` and `List` which are declared via protocols
/// `AbstractSwiftUIButton` and `AbstractSwiftUIList`. Concrete implementations are provided
/// as per platform so we have following concrete implementations
/// - `IPhoneButton`
/// - `IPhoneList`
/// - `MACButton`
/// - `MACList`
/// There can be many more products but here we have taken only two.
///
/// Now an abstract factory is defined `AbstractUIFactory`
/// Concrete implementations of this abstract factory are :
/// - `IPhoneUIFactory`
/// - `MACUIFactory`
/// Both these factories create products Button and List for respective platforms. Note a single factory here for e.g.
/// IPhoneUIFactory is creating two products i.e. a Button and a List.
///
/// Finally the UniversalApp in example is initialised with a platform specific factory and from factory it gets all
/// the products for creating it's user interface.

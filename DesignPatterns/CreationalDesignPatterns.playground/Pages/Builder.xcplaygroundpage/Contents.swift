/**
 `Builder`
 `Builder` is a creational design pattern which helps constructing a complex object in a step by step manner.
 The core idea is to buid an object by a dedicated builder type, rather than by building it via various initialiser from
 within.
 
 For example let's consider a struct House having several properties
 
 ```
 struct House {
     var numberOfBedrooms: Int
     var numberOfParking: Int
     var hasLawn: Bool
     var hasPool: Bool
 }
 ```
 
 This needs to be initialised like below
 
 ```
 let house = House(numberOfBedrooms: 2,
                   numberOfParking: 1,
                   hasLawn: true,
                   hasPool: false)
 ```
 
 There are only four properties House struct has at this moment, these can grow and so will the size of initialiser.
 Also if some of the properties can be nil or some default values then one need to create some convenience initialisers
 to cater to those demands as passing nil or default values to a huge initialiser always is again cumbersome.
 So one usually ends up in having multiple initialisers for instantiating entities like this.
 
 Builder creation design pattern tries to solve this problem in following manner. Here the properties are set and
 the object is configured by a series of chained methods ending in a build method to instantiate.
 
 ```
 let house = HouseBuilder()
     .withBedrooms(2)
     .parkings(1)
     .hasLawn()
     .build()
 ```
 
 Builder pattern may seems to be adding a more lot of code for creating objects but it does have its benefits.
 
 - Firstly it helps to remove lot of public APIs (initialisers) which need to be kept available to cater to every use
 case.
 - Secondly it can also help to prevent sharing the mutable state.
 
 
 NOTE: It's not always possible to have only one builder, if complex cases one might have to create different
 builders to create the complex object.

 `Factory`
 
 `Factory` is a creational design pattern, as creational design patterns are all about removing the complexities
 while creating objects, so is the case with factory pattern.
 `Factory` pattern tries to encapsulate implementation details for creating objecs which have a common ancestor i.e. base class.
 In `Factory` pattern the clien uses a product object which it receives from a common interface without caring
 about the exact type of concrete object returned via `Factory`
 
 In this pattern there is a `Factory` which creates some objects. These objects are the products, client needs
 eventualy and asks a `Factory` to provide those.

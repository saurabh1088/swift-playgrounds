/**
 `Factory`
 
 `Factory` is a creational design pattern, do note however it's not at all related to `Abstract Factory`.
 As creational design patterns are all about removing the complexities while creating objects, so is the case with
 factory pattern. `Factory` pattern tries to encapsulate implementation details for creating objecs which have
 a common ancestor i.e. base class.
 In `Factory` pattern the clien uses a product object which it receives from a common interface without caring
 about the exact type of concrete object returned via `Factory`

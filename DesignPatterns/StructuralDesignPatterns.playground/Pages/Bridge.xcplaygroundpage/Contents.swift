/// This approach works fine, but this example is very simple. Suppose we only have two shapes like above, i.e.
/// Circle and Square if we consider even seven colors, we are looking at fourteen classes to have each share
/// corresponds to each color.
/// This problem could be solved using bridge pattern.

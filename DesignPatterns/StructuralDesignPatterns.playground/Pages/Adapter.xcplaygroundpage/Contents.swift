 `Adapter`
 `Adapter` design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work
 together. In other words, it transforms the interface of an object to adapt it to a different object.

/// Example 1 : A conceptual one
/// In example below we have a `Client` which can take up tasks of string types. `Client` uses APIs
/// provided by `Target` which can work with Strings. Now some new APIs are required to be consumed to
/// perform some different tasks, these APIs `Adaptee` can provide but `Adaptee` can only understand Int.
/// So here comes need for adapter pattern. An `Adapter` is defined which helps `Client` to adapt using
/// `Adaptee` APIs

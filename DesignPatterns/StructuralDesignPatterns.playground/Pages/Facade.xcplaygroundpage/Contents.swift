/**
 `Facade`
 Facade structural design patterns aims in exposing several components through a single interface, thereby
 providing a simple, easy to use and understand, user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.

/// Example 1 :
/// Example below describes how a facade pattern is implemented and used. Here we have some classes
/// providing APIs for giving various solutions for creating and delivering a real estate project. A real estate project
/// will need a civil engineer to design the plan, some workers to construct the buildings as per plan and some
/// basic requirements like electrical wiring, gas connection, plumbing etc which are covered under necessities.
/// Class `Builder` is a facade here which uses all these APIs and creates the project. So for an end client
/// the `Builder` interface and it's APIs are much easier to use and manage.
/// Also it helps in situations where say instead of using `Builder` one uses `CivilEngineer`, `Worker`
/// and `Necessities` individually and then in future the implementation of `CivilEngineer`, `Worker`
/// or `Necessities` changes, then one will need to change a lot of code. Instead if all these were being used
/// via facade `Builder` only change will be required in the `Builder`.

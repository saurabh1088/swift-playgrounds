/**
 `Interface Segregation Principle`
 
 Interface Segregation Principle states that interfaces should be segregated enough so as to not force a client
 implementing the interface, implement functionality which they don't need.
 In terms of for example say classes and protocols, while implementing a protocol, a class shoudn't be forced to
 implement methods in protocol which it doesn't needs.
 Interfaces/Protocols should be focused.

/// implement various behaviours. Suppose one need to implement a Printer which can only print. If Printer tries
/// to implement `AllInOneKindViolatingISP` then it needs to forcefully implement fax and scan as well
/// which isn't desirabel. One way to overcome is implement print function properly and make other ones throw
/// exceptions.

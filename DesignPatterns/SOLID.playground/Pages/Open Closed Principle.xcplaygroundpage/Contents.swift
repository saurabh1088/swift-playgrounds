/**
 `Open Closed Principle`
 
 This principle states that a classes/modules/methods should be open for extension but closed for modifications.
 This means that once a class is written/designed, then to add new functionality it should not be modified, instead
 it should have been designed in a way that it should be able to be extended to add those functionalities.

/// by category, then one needs to write additional method to do the filter, like declared below in an extensio to

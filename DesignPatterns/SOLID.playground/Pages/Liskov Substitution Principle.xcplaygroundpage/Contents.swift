/**
 `Liskov Substitution Principle`
 
 As per Liskov Substitution Principle objects of a superclass should be replacable with objects of it's derived
 subclasses without breaking the program/application.
 
 In the example below for implementation of Area protocol `FourSideShape` it doesn't matter if Rectangle is
 passed or a Square, the area calculator method will be able to handle it.

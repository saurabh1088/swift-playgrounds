/**
 `SOLID Design Principles`
 
 Introduced by Robert C Martin (Uncle Bob)
 
 `Single Responsibility Principle`
 
 A class should have only one reason to change.
 Separation of concern.
 
 A class should have ONLY one reason to change. This means that a class should only have single responsibility
 or a single purpose for it's existence.
 This ensures classes created in s system are well defined and maintainable. If a class has only single responsibility
 it would be easier to maintain and debug it in event of future issues/changes.

/// This class `Journal` is having a single responsibility which is to represent a journal. A journal can have
/// zero or more entries, one should be able to add and remove a journal entry and that's all.
class Journal: CustomStringConvertible {
    var entries = [String]()
    var count = 0
    
    var description: String {

/// Now suppose while we wanted to write a journal, we also wanted persistence. So we want our journal and
/// it's entries to be persisted in a disk so that it could be retrieved offline as well.
/// One might be tempted to modify `Journal` class itself and add functionality to save journal entry to a
/// persistence store, like below.

/// Above code to add a new function to `Journal` to save it to a persistent store is perfectly fine and will
/// serve the purpose. HOWEVER IT VIOLATES SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE.

/// This requirement for persistance should be better serve by introducing a new class to handle persistence
/// related functionality.

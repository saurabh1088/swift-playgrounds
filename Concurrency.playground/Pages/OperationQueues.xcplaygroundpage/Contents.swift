/**
 `OperationQueue`
 
 `OperationQueue` is built on top of GCD, thereby providing a higher level abstraction for achieving concurrency.
 
 One typically adds operations, represented by abstract class `Operation` to `OperationQueue` and the
 queue will execute those operations. Operation queue will invoke these operations based on their priority and readiness.
 
 Operation once added to a queue can't be deleted.

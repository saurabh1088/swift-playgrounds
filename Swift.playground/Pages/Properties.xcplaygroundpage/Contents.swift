 `Properties`
 
 `Stored Properties`
 
 - Classes
 - Structures
 
 `Computed Properties`
 
 - Classes
 - Structures
 - Enumerations
 
 Computed properties are always var as their values are never fixed and may change.
 
 `Enumerations doesn't have stored properties`
 
 `Property Observers`
 
 Property observers can be added to :
 - Defined Stored property
 - Inherited Stored property
 - Inherited Computed property
 
 Computed property that one define doesn't need to add property observer as that can be done in property setter
 itself.
 
 If an instance of structure is assigned to a let or constant, then one can't modify the property of that structure even
 of the property in structures definition is defined to be a var. The structure instance is assigned to a constant and
 hence it can't change.
 
 `Lazy Properties : static var/let`
 
 A lazy stored property's initial value isn't calculated until it is used for the first time. A lazy property is always var.
 This is so because the value of a lazy property will be assigned once it's used hence it needs to be a var.
 Lazy properties are great to use for scenarios where the code is expensive and unlikely to be called too often.
 
 `Note: Global constants and variables are always computed lazily, in a similar manner to Lazy Stored Properties, however these aren't required to be marked with lazy keyword.`
 
 `Type Properties`
 
 These are properties which belong to a Type rather than belonging to the instance of the Type.
 Type properties can be both
 - Stored (var or let)
 - Computed (var ONLY)
 
 Stored type properties should always have a default value, because Type doesn't have any initializer which can
 initialize it's type properties and assign some value.
 
 Stored type properties when accessed for first time are lazily initialized. Swift gurantees that these will get initialized
 only once even if accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. There is no need to add keyword lazy.
 
 `What's the difference between static and class keyword?`
 
 `static`  and `class` both are keywords used to declare a Type property. `class` keyword can be used for
 computed properties for class Types so as to allow subclasses to override those.

 `class` keyword can only be used within a class Type, using inside struct will give compilor error with message :
 Class properties are only allowed within classes; use 'static' to declare a static property.
 
 Even in class, using `class` keyword for stored property will make compiler cry :
 Class stored properties not supported in classes; did you mean 'static'?.

/// `What will happen if a lazy stored property is accessed by multiple thread simultaneously?`
///
/// In this case if the lazy property when accessed by multiple thread simultaneously was still not initialized then
/// there is no gurantee that it will get initialized only once.

/// `Property Wrappers`
/// Concept of property wrapper in Swift helps in defining a layer which separates the code defining a property
/// from code which manages how the property is stored.
/// Use case for property wrapper is that suppose we have to define a property on which one needs to apply some
/// custom logic, for example we want to define a property and make sure it is thread safe, then those thread
/// safety check needs to go for all properties which needs such feature. Using property wrapper one can add
/// such c feature in a wrapper and then use the property wrapper on any property where such use case is expected.
///
/// Property wrapper basically is a `type` which wraps a given value to add some additional logic to it.
///
/// For example, let's say we need to define a property but also need to make sure it's never greater than 10.
/// Below code example `LessThanTen` & `exampleCustomPropertyWrapper()` shows how to achieve
///  that using a property wrapper.

/// When `@propertyWrapper` is used then compiler expects type to provide a `wrappedValue` else it will complain
/// with error :
/// Property wrapper type 'LessThanTen' does not contain a non-static property named 'wrappedValue'
///
/// `Can property wrapper be applied to Global variables?`
/// NO
///
/// `Can property wrapper be applied to computed properties?`
/// NO
///
/// `Can property wrapper be applied to a local variable?`
/// YES, for example one can apply a property wrapper to a variable defined locally withing scope of a function.
/// See example function below `exampleUsingPropertyWrapperInsideFunction()`
///
/// `Can one use @propertyWrapper on classes and structures both?`
/// YES

///
/// One can also define a property wrapper with initializers so that some initial value can be set. For example

/// to be less than 10, so the usage is pretty restricted, it would be great if we can set a custom maximum value.

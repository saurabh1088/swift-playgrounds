 `Properties`
 
 `Stored Properties`
 
 - Classes
 - Structures
 
 `Computed Properties`
 
 - Classes
 - Structures
 - Enumerations
 
 Computed properties are always var as theit values are never fixed and may change.
 
 `Enumerations doesn't have stored properties`
 
 `Property Observers`
 
 Property observers can be added to :
 - Defined Stored property
 - Inherited Stored property
 - Inherited Computed property
 
 Computed property that one define doesn't need to add property observer as that can be done in property setter
 itself.
 
 If an instance of structure is assigned to a let or constant, then one can't modify the property of that structure even
 of the property in structures definition is defined to be a var. The structure instance is assigned to a constant and
 hence it can't change.
 
 `Lazy Properties`
 
 A lazy stored property's initial value isn't calculated until it is used for the first time. A lazy property is always var.
 This is so because the value of a lazy property will be assigned once it's used hence it needs to be a var.
 Lazy properties are great to use for scenarios where the code is expensive and unlikely to be called too often.

/// `What will happen if a lazy stored property is accessed by multiple thread simultaneously?`
///
/// In this case if the lazy property when accessed by multiple thread simultaneously was still not initialized then
/// there is no gurantee that it will get initialized only once.

/// `Property Wrappers`
/// Concept of property wrapper in Swift helps in defining a layer which separates the code defining a property
/// from code which manages how the property is stored.
/// Use case for property wrapper is that suppose we have to define a property on which one needs to apply some
/// custom logic, for example we want to define a property and make sure it is thread safe, then those thread
/// safety check needs to go for all properties which needs such feature. Using property wrapper one can add
/// such c feature in a wrapper and then use the property wrapper on any property where such use case is expected.
/// For example, let's say we need to define a property but also need to make sure it's never greater than 10.
/// Below code example shows how to achieve that using a property wrapper.

/// When @propertyWrapper is used then compiler expects type to provide a wrappedValue else it will complain
/// with error :
/// Property wrapper type 'LessThanTen' does not contain a non-static property named 'wrappedValue'

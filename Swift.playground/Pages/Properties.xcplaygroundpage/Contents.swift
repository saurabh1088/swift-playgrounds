 `Enumerations doesn't have stored properties`
 
 `Property Observers`
 
 Property observers can be added to stored properties defined as well as to those properties which are inherited
 from parent class.
 
 If an instance of structure is assigned to a let or constant, then one can't modify the property of that structure even
 of the property in structures definition is defined to be a var. The structure instance is assigned to a constant and
 hence it can't change.
 
 `Lazy Properties`
 
 A lazy stored property's initial value isn't calculated until it is used for the first time. A lazy property is always var.
 This is so because the value of a lazy property will be assigned once it's used hence it needs to be a var.
 Lazy properties are great to use for scenarios where the code is expensive and unlikely to be called too often.

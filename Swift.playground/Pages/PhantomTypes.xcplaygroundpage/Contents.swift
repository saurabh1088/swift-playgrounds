// MARK: Example 1 : Without phantom types
/// In example below, we have structs defining employee and company. Both employee and company will need
/// a unique identity. For providing identity we have `Identifier` which provides a property `id`. Both
/// `Employee` and `Company` further use this `Identifier` type to declare their unique identifiers.
/// Now in example `exampleWithoutPhantomType()` an employee and a company are created and then
/// are compared if their identifiers are equal. This comparison shouldn't be valid as identity of an emplyee is
/// altogether different from identity of a company. However as same `Identifier` was used to define the
/// identities for both, it works and we get printed result `Employee and company are same`. However
/// this is wrong.
/// In Example 2 below, we will see how to overcome this issue using phantom types and have more type
/// safety with our logic.

    let id: Int

// MARK: -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// MARK: Example 2 : Using phantom types
/// In example below we defined a identifier almost same as example 1 above, however there is a key difference.
/// In `SafeIdentifier` there is a generic type defined which is `Type`. However this isn't used in the
/// struct's definition further. However now when our `SafeEmployee` and `SafeCompany` use this new
/// `SafeIdentifier` type for defining their identities, one gets type safety from compilor. Now one can no
/// longer accidently compare identity of an employee against that of company, which in previous implementation
/// would have been possible and could have lead to potential issues.

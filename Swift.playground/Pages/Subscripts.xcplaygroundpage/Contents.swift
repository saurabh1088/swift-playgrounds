/**
 `Subscripts`
 
 `Subscripts` are shortcuts, used to access elements of a collection. Subscripts can be defined by:
 
 - Classes
 - Structures
 - Enumerations
 
 For example elements in an Array can be accessed using index inside square brackets as following
 
 ```
 var someArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 someArray[0]
 ```
 
 A type can define more than one subscripts.
 Subscripts aren't limited to single parameter, multiple input parameters can be also provided.
 
 To define one needs to use keyword `subscript`. The definition itself is similar to the way one defines computed
 properties.
 
 Subscripts can be read-only OR read-write. In case of read-only one needs to define only the get block.

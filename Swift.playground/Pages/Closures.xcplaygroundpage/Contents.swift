/**
 `Closures`
 
 Quoting from Apple's documentation :
 `Closures are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code.`
 
 Closures are similar to what we have as blocks in Objective C and C. Also similar to concepts like lambdas in
 some other languages.
 
 Closures can be
 - Assigned to variables
 - Passed as arguments to functions
 - Returned from functions
 - Can capture and store references to any constant or variables from context in which closure is defined
 
 Capturing of constants or variables by closure, from the context in which closure is defined is known as
 `closing over` those constants and variables.

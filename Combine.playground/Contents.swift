 `What is Combine?`
 
 Combine is a framework developed by Apple. It aims to provide declarative APIs for processing values over time.
 This providing of values over time is something we will come to know as publishers, but later on to that.
 This framework was introduced in WWDC 2019

 Combine enables us to write funtional reactive code by using it's declarative API. So it provides the
 functional reative programming (FRP) paradigm capability to Swift.
 
 For e.g. in SwiftUI framework the `ObservableObject` and `@Published` are actually using Combine
 behind the scenes.
 
 `Functional Reactive Programming`
 
 Before proceeding with Combine in details, it's necessary to understand what is FRP i.e. Functional Reactive Programming.
 Functional Reactive Programming is a programming paradigm.

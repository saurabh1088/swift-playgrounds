/// Example 1 :
/// In method example `publisherSubscribedOnDifferentSerialQueue` we are using ```.subscribe(on:```
/// ```.subscribe(on:```  takes a `Scheduler` which in example's case is a serial dispatch queue.
/// ```.subscribe(on:``` will set the scheduler passed to it as the one on which we like current subscription
/// to be managed on. So this scheduler will be used for :-
/// - Creating the subscription
/// - Cancelling the subscription
/// - Requesting input
/// ```.subscribe(on:``` sets  the scheduler to subscribe the upstream on, but along with this there is
/// side effect, which is when this is used scheduler for downstream will also get changed.
/// So in Example 1, when a serial queue is used as a scheduler, the downstream subscriber .sink also executes
/// the block with print statements on same serial queue scheduler.
